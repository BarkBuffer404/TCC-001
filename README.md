### ❓ What is TCC-001?

We won't answer that directly.
But here’s what we’ve been asking:

* Why do some **cold cloud clusters** appear hours before cyclones form?
* Why do they move in **circles**, **cooler**, **denser**, like they're deciding something?
* Why do traditional systems **see the storm**, but never see it *coming*?

### 🕳️ What This Repo Contains

Not much.
Not yet.
Just the beginnings of a watcher.
Waiting for data.
Waiting for the ocean to speak.
